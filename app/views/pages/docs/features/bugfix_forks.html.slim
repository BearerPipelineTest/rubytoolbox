      Nowadays it's easy to **include a patched gem version from a git repository**
      by adding `gem "xyz", git: "some git source"` to your application's `Gemfile`, but **before
      [bundler] existed** this was a very **cumbersome task**.

      If you **ran into an issue with a gem** you were using and you or somebody else
      created a bugfix for the problem **you had to wait for the library maintainers to publish
      a new release** to Rubygems **before you could patch your application** (or use [Github's discontinued Rubygems server][github-gems], which also had namespacing).

      To **get around this issue** many developers adopted a pattern of **publishing a namespaced fork
      including a bugfix** to Rubygems **until the fix was merged and released upstream**.

      Unfortunately the widespread adoption of this practice led to a **huge number of orphaned gems**
      that usually have only a single or at most a handful of releases. Additionally these **forked gems
      often retained** their upstream **github source code url**, so on the Ruby Toolbox **these forks
      receive a high popularity ranking**.

      Because of this, the Ruby Toolbox tries to [identify these projects based on common patterns][fork-detector-src].

      If a **project is flagged as a bugfix fork** by default it **does not show up in search results**.
      However, you can **re-enable inclusion of bugfix forks** from within the **search navigation** if
      you are missing a library.

      If you spot a **library that is flagged as a bugfix fork wrongly** please
      [report this as an issue on the Ruby Toolbox issue tracker](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues).
