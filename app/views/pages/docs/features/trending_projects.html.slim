      To allow **discovery of still relatively unknown libraries** that are **gaining popularity in the community**
      we provide an overview of **[Trending Projects](/trends)** every week, based on Rubygem downloads.

      On a high level, here's **what makes a project "trending"**:

        * The project had **more than 10000 Rubygem downloads in the previous 4 weeks**
        * The project's relative downloads (percentage of downloads within the given time period against all time downloads) **growth must have increased over the previous 4 week time period** to spot libraries that have seen sustained growth over at least the last 5 weeks to reduce "false positives" caused by brief spikes
        * The project must have had **a release in the last 6 months**
        * The project **must not be a [bugfix fork][forks_docs]**

      Finally, projects are **sorted by the relative number of downloads related to their total downloads**.

      For more details into the exact query used you can of course also take a look at the [database query used][code] directly in the code.
