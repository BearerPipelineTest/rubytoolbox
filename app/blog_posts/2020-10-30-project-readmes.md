# Project READMEs

Hello everyone,

**I hope you're getting through this awkward year reasonably well!**

You can now find **[project READMEs shown on individual project pages][PR]** directly on the Ruby Toolbox.

This should save you a few clicks through to the repositories of libraries you are looking into as you can now find this content directly here:

Best,<br/>Christoph
