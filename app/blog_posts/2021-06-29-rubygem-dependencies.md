# Rubygem dependencies on project pages

Hello everyone, I hope you're well!

I recently added **[displaying of rubygem dependencies to project details pages][PR]**.

This also includes the **[corresponding health indicators for each dependency][health]** so you can **also get a quick overview on the number and state of a project's dependencies**

**I hope you find this new addition useful - Stay safe and healthy!**

Best,<br/>Christoph
